## Welcome to the Easy Crafting repository

Easy Crafting is a Minecraft mod that provides similar functionality to the now out of date mods like Crafting Table II (by ljdp) and Crafting Table III (by Zeldo).

I also plan to extend its functionality and usefulness by implementing new features and compatibility with popular mods.

If you have a mod that Easy Crafting is not working properly with, please submit an issue (and/or a pull request to fix it) and the accompanying crash report (if there is one).

### Official Builds
Official builds of the mod can be found [here](temp-link).

### Contributing
If you wish to submit a pull request to fix bugs or broken behavior feel free to do so. If you would like to add features or change existing behavior, please discuss it with me (Lepko) first.
